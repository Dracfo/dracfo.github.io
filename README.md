## Inspiration
---
This app was created as the final project for the Web: Dynamic Site Design course at Humber College. As such, it draws on the lessons and techniques taught in the course regarding HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

The design of the main page web app was inspired by the [Steven Mengin's Portfolio Website](https://www.stevenmengin.com/).
